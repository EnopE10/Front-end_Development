						<h4>Field Conditions</h4>

Volunteers schedule is flexible and can vary depending on the needs of the placement.This program is particularly suited for those volunteers who are interested in health issues and doing ‘hands-on’ clinical work.

						<p>Volunteering Solutions strives to provide best of the living and other arrangements to its volunteers. Like we keep saying, just pack your bags and arrive at your placement destination. From your airport pickup, stay, meals, weekend tours and other nitty gritties, VolSol manages everything for you.On weekdays, participants have free time in the evenings and spend time relaxing at their accommodation or socializing with other volunteers and the local people.</p>
						<p>ou will be met by our representative at Kotoka International Airport in Accra from where you are transferred to your project location. Volunteers will stay overnight in Accra at hotel accommodation provided by Volunteering Solutions and travel to Tamale the next day. For those volunteers who are arriving in Accra in the morning, you can also take a connecting flight to Tamale directly from Accra. You will be met at Tamale airport and transferred to your accommodation in that case.On weekdays, participants have free time in the evenings and spend time relaxing at their accommodation or socializing with other volunteers and the local people.</p>
						<p>Volunteers will be staying at a standard Ghanaian volunteer homestay managed by the local program coordinator. In case space is not available in the volunteer home, you will be accommodated with a Ghanaian Host family. Accommodation is either provided in an individual or shared room along with other volunteer. By staying with a family you will experience the local Ghanaian culture, language customs and traditions. There are separate rooms for male and female volunteers with shared toilet facilities. Participants should note that living is of basic standard and you should not expect luxuries. Power cuts are common in Ghana and most rural houses do not have running water.</p>
						<p>Bedding is provided, however volunteers need to bring their own towels and mosquito nets (these can also be purchased in Ghana). Air conditioning is available in the volunteer house and the participants need to pay extra charge to avail the facility in country.</p>
						<p>An orientation and briefing session will be provided by your local coordinator. Areas like culture, safety, locations, transportation are covered in the Orientation. After your orientation is over, you will be introduced to your project and also given a tour of the local market and town of Tamale.</p>
						<p class="description-end">Volunteers are provided with 2 meals (breakfast and dinner) at the host family house. Ghanaian cuisine consists primarily of starches, soups, beans, meat and fish. The Starches consist mainly of rice and doughy balls made from mashed cassava, plantain or yams.  Famous Ghanaian dishes include Banku and Fufu.</p>

							<h2>Project Start Dates</h2>
							<p>As of 2017, text messages are used by youth and adults for personal, family, business and social purposes. Governmental and non-governmental organizations use text messaging for communication between colleagues. In the 2010s, the sending of short informal messages has become an accepted part of many cultures, as happened earlier with emailing.</p>
							<p>This makes texting a quick and easy way to communicate with friends, family and colleagues, including in contexts where a call would be impolite or inappropriate.</p>
							<p>Like e-mail and voicemail, and unlike calls (in which the caller hopes to speak directly with the recipient), texting does not require the caller and recipient to both be free at the same moment; this permits communication even between busy individuals.</p>
							<p>Advertisers and service providers use direct text marketing to send messages to mobile users about promotions.mobile users about promotions.</p>

						<h2>Organization</h2>
						<p class="p">Text messaging is most often used between private mobile phone users, as a substitute for voice calls in situations where voice communication is impossible or undesirable (e.g., during a school class or a work meeting). Texting is also used to communicate very brief messages, such as informing someone that you will be late or reminding a friend or colleague about a meeting.</p>
						<p>Short message services are developing very rapidly throughout the world. SMS is particularly popular in Europe, Asia (excluding Japan; see below), United States, Australia and New Zealand and is also gaining influence in Africa. Popularity has grown to a sufficient extent that the term texting (used as a verb meaning the act of mobile phone users sending short messages back and forth) has entered the common lexicon. Young Asians consider SMS as the most popular mobile phone application.</p>
